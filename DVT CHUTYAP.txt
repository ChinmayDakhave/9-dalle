                         PRACTICAL 2

Aim: Adding Data Sources – Set up connectors, select tables, perform joins/unions, edit metadata, add hierarchies/calculated fields, optimize performance.

STEPS: 

A — Start & connect to the Excel file
Open Tableau Public (double-click desktop icon or Start → type “Tableau Public” → Enter).

On the Tableau start page, look at the left pane titled Connect.

Click Microsoft Excel.

In the file dialog that opens, navigate to the folder with your dataset (e.g., your_dataset.xlsx) → select it → click Open.

Tableau loads the Data Source page showing sheet names from the Excel file on the left.




B — Selecting tables (preview & load)
On the Data Source page, you’ll see sheet names (tables) listed on the left (icons with sheet names).

To preview a table: click the sheet name once → the grid preview appears in the central canvas.

To add a table to the canvas for use, drag the sheet name and drop it onto the central canvas area. (Do this for any primary table you want to work with, e.g., Orders.)

If you need multiple tables loaded for joins/unions, drag each table onto the canvas.



C — Performing Joins (Orders + Returns example)
Make sure you have the Data Source tab open and Orders already on the canvas.

Drag the Returns sheet and drop it onto the Orders table (drop it to the right of Orders) — Tableau will create a join between them.

A join icon/box appears between the two tables. Click the small join icon (or the join area) to open the Join Configuration panel.

In the Join Configuration:

Choose the Join Type from the dropdown (Inner, Left, Right, Full Outer).

Inner = only rows that match in both tables.

Left = all Orders + matching Returns.

Right = all Returns + matching Orders.

Full Outer = all rows from both.

Set the join clause: from left table choose the matching field (e.g., Order ID) and from right table choose the matching field (e.g., Order ID or Returned Order ID).

If names differ, use the dropdown to pick the correct fields; you can change operator (equals, >, <) if needed.

To add more join conditions (e.g., match on Order Date too), click the Add (+) beside the join clause and choose additional fields.

When finished, click outside the dialog — the joined preview will show resulting columns. Scroll to preview rows and check for expected matches / nulls.



D — Performing Unions (stack rows)
If you need to union (stack) sheets that have the same columns (e.g., Sales_2019, Sales_2020): on Data Source page either:

Drag one sheet below another until you see the label “Drag sheets here to union” and drop — OR

Click the small dropdown on a sheet and choose Union → in the union area drag other sheets into it → or use Wildcard Union and enter a pattern.

After union, preview the stacked rows in the data grid to ensure columns align; fix column names if misaligned.




E — Edit metadata (rename fields, change types, aliases)
In the Data Source page or Data pane (left of a worksheet) you can edit field metadata.

Rename a field (e.g., Order Date → Date of Order):

Option 1 (Data Source grid): click the column header Order Date → right-click → Rename → type Date of Order → Enter.

Option 2 (Data pane): right-click field name → Rename → type new name → Enter.

Change data type (Row ID from Number (whole) → Number (decimal)):

In Data pane, find Row ID. Click the small data-type icon (shows # or abc) next to the field → choose Number (decimal).

Or right-click field → Change Data Type → Number (decimal).

Create an Alias (Ship Mode: alias “High Class” for “Standard Class”):

In the Data pane, right-click Ship Mode → Aliases….

In the Aliases dialog: find member Standard Class → click its alias cell and type High Class → Click OK.



F — Create Hierarchy (Product Category)
In the Data pane (on any worksheet): locate Category and Sub-Category.

Create a hierarchy two ways:

Right-click Category → Create → Hierarchy → type Product Category → Click OK → then drag Sub-Category into the new Product Category folder.

OR drag Sub-Category onto Category and when Tableau asks to create a hierarchy, name it Product Category.

To use it: open a new worksheet → drag Product Category to Rows. You’ll see a small expand (+) control next to the hierarchy in the view.

Drag Sales to Columns → Tableau will show bars (category expanded to sub-category when you click +).



G — Create Calculated Field (Profit Ratio)
In the Data pane, right-click empty space → Create Calculated Field… (or from menu Analysis → Create Calculated Field).

In the calculation editor:

Name the field: Profit Ratio.

Formula (basic): [Profit] / [Sales] and click OK.

(Better/safer formula to prevent division by zero and respect aggregation): IF SUM([Sales]) != 0 THEN SUM([Profit]) / SUM([Sales]) ELSE 0 END — this gives correct aggregated ratio.

After creation, the new field appears under Measures (or Calculated fields) in the Data pane.

To visualize: new worksheet → drag Sub-Category to Columns → drag Profit Ratio to Rows. If necessary, click the measure and change aggregation (AVG or SUM depending on your formula) or use the aggregated formula recommended above.



H — Add Filters (Profit filter example)
On a worksheet, in the Data pane drag Profit to the Filters shelf.

In the Filter dialog that appears choose how to filter: Range of values / At least / At most / Select discrete values → click OK.

To let users change filter in view: right-click the Profit pill on Filters shelf → Show Filter. The filter control appears on the right; click the dropdown on it to change its display (Slider, Single Value Dropdown, etc.).

If you want the filter to act before other filters (improve performance), right-click the filter pill → Add to Context (it becomes a gray context filter).



I — Performance optimization steps (practical checklist)
Create an Extract (faster than live for large datasets):

Data menu → select your data source → Extract Data… → (optionally add extract filters and aggregation) → click Extract and save the .hyper file.

Use Data Source Filters (limit rows at source): Data Source tab → top-right or Data menu → Add → Filter → choose field and limit values.

Hide unused fields: in Data pane right-click fields you won’t use → Hide. Fewer fields = faster load.

Use Context Filters for expensive filters: right-click filter pill → Add to Context. This reduces data for subsequent filters.

Limit marks and level of detail: avoid plotting millions of marks. Aggregate at higher level (use SUM, AVG, or group) instead of row-level detail.

Minimize quick filters: each quick filter can slow the workbook; prefer single-select dropdowns or parameter controls.

Optimize calculations: use aggregated calculations (SUM([Profit]) / SUM([Sales])) instead of row-level calculated fields when charting aggregates. Avoid row-by-row expensive calculations on massive datasets.

Use extracts for published workbooks and refresh extracts periodically instead of live queries for large remote databases.

Test performance after changes: open new worksheet → build the heavy view and note response times; revert changes if needed.



J — Final checks & save
Preview worksheets: click each worksheet tab and check visuals, labels, headers, and tooltip values.

Format axis labels and headers if needed: right-click axis → Edit Axis… or Format → adjust fonts/number formats.

Save your workbook: File → Save As (local) OR if using Tableau Public: File → Save to Tableau Public → sign in with your Tableau Public account → enter title → click Save.

Save types: .twb (workbook, links to external data) or .twbx (packaged workbook, includes extracts and local files). For sharing, use .twbx.

Export images or PDF if required: File → Export As Image or Print to PDF (depending on version).






        PRACTICAL 3

Creating Data Visualization

STEPS:

A.	Bar Graph:

A bar graph can be defined as a graphical representation of data,
quantities, or numbers using bars or strips. They are used to compare and contrast
different types of data, frequencies, or other measures of distinct categories of data.

Steps:
1.	Connect to Data Source by selecting the appropriate connector (e.g., Excel, SQL Server, CSV).

2.	Create a New Worksheet

3.	Select Dimensions and Measures
●	Identify the dimensions (categorical data) and measures (numerical data) you want to visualize.
●	Drag a dimension (e.g., Product Category) to the Columns shelf.
●	Drag a measure (e.g., Sales) to the Rows shelf.

4.	Choose the Bar Graph Type
●	Click on the “Show Me” panel on the right side of the screen.
●	Select the bar chart icon from the available chart types.

5.	Customize the Bar Graph
●	Sort Bars: You can sort the bars in ascending or descending order by clicking on the sort button next to the axis labels.
●	Color: Drag a dimension or measure to the Color shelf to differentiate bars by color.
●	Labels: Drag a measure to the Label shelf to display data labels on the bars.
●	Tooltips: Customize the tooltips by dragging fields to the Tooltip shelf.


B.	Stack Bar graph:

The stacked bar chart (aka stacked bar graph) extends the standard bar chart from looking at numeric values across one categorical variable to two.
Each bar in a standard bar chart is divided into a number of sub-bars stacked
end to end, each one corresponding to a level of the second categorical variable. 

Steps:
1.	Follow the same three steps as creating a bar graph.

2.	Create a stacked bar chart
●	Drag another categorical field (e.g., Sub-Category, Region) to the Color shelf on the Marks card. This will divide the bars into different segments (stacked).

3.	Adjust the visualization
●	Ensure the Marks card is set to Bar.
●	If your bars are not stacking, click on the Analysis menu at the top, then Stack Marks, and make sure Automatic or On is selected.


C.	Pie Chart:

Pie charts can be used to show percentages of a whole, and represent
percentages at a set point in time. Unlike bar graphs and line graphs, pie charts do not show changes over time. The following pages describe the different parts of a pie chart.

Steps:
1.	Follow the same three steps as we did while creating a bar graph.

2.	Add Data to the Chart

3.	Configure the Pie Chart
●	On the Marks card, change the mark type from Automatic to Pie.
●	Drag the dimension (e.g., Category) to the Color shelf on the Marks card to differentiate the slices by color.
●	Drag the same dimension (e.g., Category) to the Label shelf on the Marks card to display labels on the slices.
●	Optionally, drag the measure (e.g., Sales) to the Label shelf to show the value or percentage on each slice.

4.	Adjust and Format the Pie Chart.

5.	Add a Title and Final Touches.


D.	Scatter plot:

A scatter plot (aka scatter chart, scatter graph) uses dots to represent values for two different numeric variables. The position of each dot on the horizontal and vertical axis indicates values for an individual data point. Scatter plots are used to observe relationships between variables.

Steps:
1.	Follow the same three steps we did while creating bar graph

2.	Convert to Scatter Plot
●	By default, Tableau may not display the data as a scatter plot
immediately. To ensure it's a scatter plot, go to the “Show Me” panel on the right and select the scatter plot option (usually a set of dots in a grid).



E .Line chart:

A line chart (aka line plot, line graph) uses points connected by line segments from left to right to demonstrate changes in value. The horizontal axis depicts a continuous progression, often that of time, while the vertical axis reports values for a metric of interest across that progression.

Steps:
1.	Follow the same initial steps.

2.	Change Marks to Line
●	By default, Tableau might not choose a line chart. Go to the "Marks" card, click on the dropdown menu, and select "Line."

3.	Adjust Date Level.

4.	Format the Chart.

5.	Add Titles and Labels.



       PRACTICAL 4

Aim: Aggregate Functions and Calculated Fields – Use aggregates/calculated fields, handle text/date fields, apply logical functions /parameters, search text fields.

STEPS:


Perfect 👍 I see your **Practical No. 04** is about *Aggregate Functions and Calculated Fields* in Tableau. The file lists topics but not the exact “how-to.” Let me rewrite this into **super easy, step-by-step instructions** you can actually perform in Tableau without confusion.

---

# 📝 Practical 04 – Aggregate Functions & Calculated Fields

Step 1: Importing Data

1. Open **Tableau Public / Tableau Desktop**.
2. In the **Connect** pane → click **Microsoft Excel** (or CSV).
3. Select your dataset file → click **Open**.
4. Go to **Sheet1** (worksheet) to start building.


 Step 2: Aggregate Functions

Aggregate functions summarize data (total, average, count).

1. **SUM**

   * Drag `Sales` (or any numeric field) to **Rows**.
   * By default, Tableau applies **SUM(Sales)**.
   * You’ll see a bar chart showing total sales.

2. **AVG**

   * Right-click `SUM(Sales)` on the Rows shelf → **Measure** → **Average**.
   * Now you see average sales instead of total.

3. **COUNT**

   * Drag `Order ID` to Rows → right-click → **Measure** → **Count**.
   * Tableau shows how many records (orders) exist.


Step 3: Calculated Fields

1. Right-click in **Data pane** → **Create Calculated Field**.
2. Name it: `Profit Ratio`.
3. Enter formula:

   "[Profit] / [Sales]"
   
4. Click **OK**.
5. Drag `Profit Ratio` into Rows (or Columns) to visualize.


 Step 4: Text Functions

Text functions help clean or transform string fields.

1. Right-click in Data pane → **Create Calculated Field**.
2. Example: `Upper_Customer`

   "UPPER([Customer Name])"
  
3. Add to view to see all customer names in uppercase.


 Step 5: Date Functions

1. Create Calculated Field → name: `Order Year`.
2. Formula:

   "YEAR([Order Date])"
   
3. Drag it into Columns to view sales by year.


 Step 6: Logical Functions

1. Create Calculated Field → name: `High Sales`.
2. Formula:
   "IF [Sales] > 500 THEN "High" ELSE "Low" END"
 
3. Drag this field to Color shelf → records get colored as “High” or “Low.”


 Step 7: Parameters

1. In Data pane, click dropdown → **Create Parameter**.
2. Name it: `Sales Threshold`.
3. Data type: **Integer** → Current value = 1000.
4. Right-click the parameter → **Show Parameter Control**.
5. Create Calculated Field:

   
   IF [Sales] > [Sales Threshold] THEN "Above Target" ELSE "Below Target" END
   
6. Use this field in a chart; adjust threshold slider to see changes.


Step 8: Searching Text Fields

1. Go to a worksheet with `Customer Name` or `Product Name`.
2. In the top right of the view, click the **Search box**.
3. Type part of a name (e.g., “Chair”) → Tableau filters instantly.

Aim: Interactive Dashboards - Considerations for dashboard creation, create/place charts, add titles/navigation/buttons/actions.


STEPS:

1. Bar Chart (Alcohol Consuming vs Lung Cancer):

Open Tableau Public → connect to Lung Cancer dataset.

Drag Alcohol Consuming → Columns.

Drag Number of Records (Count) → Rows.

Drag Lung Cancer → Color → Bar chart is ready.



2. Doughnut Chart (Lung Cancer):

Create a new sheet.

Create a calculated field: type 0 → name it Dummy.

Drag Dummy → Rows twice.

Right-click second axis → select Dual Axis.

Drag Lung Cancer to Color and Count of Records to Label.

Format → Remove center part → this becomes a Doughnut chart.




3  to Create Doughnut Chart (Chest Pain) in Tableau

Create New Sheet:
Click the new worksheet icon at the bottom.

Create Dummy Field:
Go to Analysis → Create Calculated Field.
Name it Dummy.
Enter 0 → OK.

Add Dummy Twice:
Drag Dummy → Rows.
Drag Dummy again → Rows (so you have two axes).

Make Dual Axis:
Right-click the second Dummy axis → choose Dual Axis.
Right-click axis headers → uncheck Show Header (to hide them).

Use Chest Pain Field:
Drag Chest Pain → Color.
Drag Number of Records (Count) → Label.

Format to Doughnut Shape:
In Marks Card, change chart type to Pie for both Dummy fields.
On one of the pies → reduce size (this becomes the hole).
Align the two pies → this forms a Doughnut Chart.

Final Touch:
 Format colors → adjust labels inside/outside.


4. Histogram (Age):

Create a new sheet.
Drag Age → Rows.
Click Show Me → select Histogram
